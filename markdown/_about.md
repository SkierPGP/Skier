###*Skier* is a GnuPG compatible key server designed as an alternative to the aging SKS.  
Skier makes no guarantee to work with other PGP implementations such as Enigmail that connect to keyservers. It also makes no guarantee to be compatible with SKS in any way other than the required routes for GnuPGP.
